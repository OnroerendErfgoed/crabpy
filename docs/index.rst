   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to CRABpy's documentation!
==================================

This library provides access to the CRAB and CAPAKEY webservices operated by 
the AGIV_. Because connecting to these SOAP services from python can be somewhat 
complicated, this library makes it easier to use the service.

We also plan to offer a somewhat more opionated wrapper around the services to
straighten out some rough edges in the API and as an integration point for some
caching.
